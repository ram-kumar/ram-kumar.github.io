### Programming

This section covers some programming questions. The goal is to develop logic and doing basic programming exercises. All of these programs can be developed in any language of your convenience.

```markdown

1. Check whether a number [taken as an input] is even or odd 
2. Check wheter an input character is an vowel or not 
3. Write a program to take in two numbers [dividend and divisor]. 
   Output of the program should be the quotient and remainder.
4. Calculate the sum of all natural numbers upto a given/input number 
5. Write a program to swap two varibles 
        `Ex: a = 5, b = 10
         At the end of the program/logic, a = 10, b = 5`

```
