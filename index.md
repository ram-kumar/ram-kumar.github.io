### Programming

This section covers some programming questions. The goal is to develop logic by doing basic programming exercises. All of these programs can be developed in any language of your convenience.

```markdown

1. Check whether a number [taken as an input] is even or odd 
2. Check wheter an input character is an vowel or not 
3. Write a program to take in two numbers [dividend and divisor]. 
   Output of the program should be the quotient and remainder.
4. Calculate the sum of all natural numbers upto a given/input number 
5. Write a program to swap two varibles 
        `Ex: a = 5, b = 10
         At the end of the program/logic, a = 10, b = 5`

```

### Programming Environment Setup

```markdown

1. Setup Linux in a VM [TODO Link]
2. Install C, C++, python packages
    `# sudo apt-get install gcc
     # sudo apt-get install g++
     # sudo apt-get install python`
3. Install Editor called gvim - There are various editors - we will focus on vim/gvim
    `# sudo apt-get install vim-gtk3`
4. Launch gvim from command prompt
    `# gvim`
5. Explore gvim editor - like any editor you can save a file, edit a file etc.
6. Compiling a C program saved/edited through gvim. Let us say the file is a.c
    `# gcc a.c
        This will create an executable file - which can be run -  called a.out 
      or
    # gcc a.c -o myfirstprog
        This will create an executable file - which can be run - called myfirstprog`
7. Compiling a C++ program. Let us say the file is a.cpp
    `# g++ a.cpp
        This will create an executable file - which can be run -  called a.out 
      or
     # g++ a.cpp -o myfirstprog
        This will create an executable file - which can be run - called myfirstprog`
8. Running a program compiled for C/C++ from terminal [for python, there is no step of compilation]
    `# a.out 
      or 
     # myfirstprog'

```
